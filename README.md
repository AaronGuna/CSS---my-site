# CSS---my-site
I created this personal webpage using HTML and CSS as an exploration of web design. The page features an animated cloud background, an introduction to myself as a programmer, details about my education and skills, and a contact section. It's a snapshot of my skills and interests, and a testament to my CSS styling experimentation.
